- Age (of customer; old/middle/young);
- Gender (male/female);
- OwnHome (whether customer owns home; yes/no)
- Married (single/married);

- Children (number of children; 0â€“3); 
- History (of previous purchase volume; low/medium/high/NA; NA means that this customer has not yet purchased); 
- Catalogs (number of catalogs sent);
